Dear Amazon SDE Internship Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Software Development Engineer Intern position at Amazon. As a Computer Science undergraduate graduating in [graduation year], I'm eager to bring my technical skills, passion for building scalable systems, and fast learning ability to a team that's shaping the future of distributed computing.

In my recent academic and personal projects, I've worked extensively with Python and Java to build backend services and distributed applications. For instance, I led a team project where we built a fault-tolerant messaging system using multi-threaded Java, enabling real-time communication across simulated nodes. This sparked my deep interest in scalable, high-availability systemsâ€”the very challenges that Amazon engineers solve every day.

What excites me most about this opportunity is Amazon's relentless focus on customer-centric innovation and its culture of ownership and impact. I'm particularly drawn to the chance to work on AWS technologies, which I've used in academic cloud computing labs and want to explore further in a production-scale environment. I'm confident that my adaptability and drive to continuously learn will allow me to quickly contribute to meaningful projects and grow from Amazon's world-class mentorship.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be thrilled to contribute to Amazon's mission of delivering for customers at scale and to gain hands-on experience that will shape me into a better engineer. I look forward to the opportunity to learn, build, and innovate at Amazon.

Sincerely,
[Your Full Name]
