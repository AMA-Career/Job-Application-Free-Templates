## Template

Dear Meta iOS Engineering Team,

I'm excited to apply for the iOS Software Engineer position at Meta. With over three years of experience developing native iOS applications in Swift and Objective-C, I've built, optimized, and maintained apps that reach thousands of daily users—and I'm eager to bring that expertise to the teams behind some of the world's most widely used mobile platforms.

At my current role, I led the development of a custom messaging interface for a community-based app, crafting reusable UI components and optimizing view hierarchies to reduce load times by 35%. Working closely with backend teams, I implemented efficient network request handling and caching strategies, resulting in smoother user experiences and increased session duration. Beyond technical execution, I've contributed to product decisions by analyzing user behavior data and translating insights into iterative UI/UX improvements—especially in socially-driven and communication-heavy features.

Meta's mission to build meaningful connections through technology resonates deeply with me. I'm particularly inspired by the opportunity to work on platforms like Messenger or Instagram, where performance, personalization, and elegant interaction design directly impact billions of users. I'm comfortable working across multithreaded environments, maintaining scalable codebases, and collaborating cross-functionally with design and research teams to push products from concept to release.

I'd love the opportunity to contribute my iOS expertise to Meta's mobile engineering efforts, and to grow alongside one of the most impactful development teams in the world. Thank you for your consideration—I look forward to the chance to connect.

Warm regards,
[Your Full Name]
