## Template

Dear Microsoft Bing AI Infrastructure Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Software Engineer position on the Bing AI Infrastructure team at Microsoft. With over six years of experience in building scalable distributed systems, designing cloud-native architectures, and deploying machine learning solutions at scale, I'm excited by the opportunity to contribute to one of the most advanced search platforms in the world.

In my current role, I lead the development of end-to-end ML model deployment pipelines that support real-time inference and continuous model retraining on AWS and Kubernetes. I've designed system architectures that handle millions of daily requests with low latency, incorporating microservices, asynchronous messaging, and automated monitoring. My work in CI/CD has helped reduce our deployment cycle time by over 40%, enabling rapid iteration without compromising stability.

Collaboration is central to my engineering approach. I work closely with data scientists to productionize models, translating experimental code into performant services. I also partner with product teams and SREs to ensure infrastructure is resilient, observable, and cost-efficient. These experiences have deepened my understanding of the intersection between platform reliability and AI innovationâ€”making Microsoft's mission to empower everyone through intelligent tools especially compelling.

The opportunity to build web-scale indexing and semantic systems that power Bing's AI capabilities is exactly the kind of technical and strategic challenge I'm looking for next. I'd be thrilled to contribute my expertise to your team's efforts and help shape the future of search, recommendations, and personalized user experiences.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can add value to Microsoft's AI infrastructure initiatives.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
